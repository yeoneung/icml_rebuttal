> How does the integration of preconditioned Langevin dynamics with Thompson sampling specifically address the challenge of sampling efficiency in high-dimensional spaces, and what inspired this novel approach over other potential methods?

- Thank you for bringing up the dimensionality problem. 

- For motivation of our approach, we would first refer to Lemme 3.1

Suppose Assumption 2.1 holds and the potential of the prior satisfies $\nabla^2_\theta U_1(\cdot)= \lambda I_{dn}$ for some $\lambda>0$. Then, for all $\theta$ and $t$, we have
$m I_{dn} \preceq  P_t^{-\frac{1}{2}}\nabla^2 U_t(\theta)P_t^{-\frac{1}{2}}  \preceq M I_{dn}$, where $m=\min\{ \underline m, 1\}$ and $M = \max {\overline m, 1}$. 

> Given the paper's reduction of restrictive assumptions in achieving an regret bound, what theoretical or practical limitations were encountered in removing these assumptions, and how were they overcome?


> Can you summarize the core difficulties in theoretical analysis of this integration? How do overcome them?
